## About

This repository holds a Jupyter Notebook you can read [here](https://github.com/marcolindner-de/titanic-survival-prediction/blob/main/titanic-survival-prediction.ipynb).

It is based on my graduation project for the Data Engineering Carreer Path Certification on [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-engineering/). It uses a self implemented generic Pipeline class to automatically load, transform, filter and analyse data from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). The generic Pipeline is build on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) data structure.

## Prerequisites

The notebook was build using Python 3.9.2. If you want to rebuild it, you can set up a virtual Python environment. The only dependency you will need is ipykernel (the IPython kernel for Jupyter to run the notebook).
