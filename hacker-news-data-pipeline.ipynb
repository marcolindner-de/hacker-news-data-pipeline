    "We began with the concepts of functional programming, and then built our own data pipeline class in Python. We learned about advanced Python concepts such as the decorators, closures, and good API design. We also learned how to implement a directed acyclic graph as the scheduler for our pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we built a robust data pipeline that schedules our tasks in the correct order! In this project, we will use the pipeline we have been building, and apply it to a real world data pipeline project. From a JSON API, we will filter, clean, aggregate, and summarize data in a sequence of tasks that will apply these transformations for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will use comes from a [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) (HN) API that returns [JSON data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) of the top stories in 2014 (sample was shrinked to January only to keep the file size smaller). If you're unfamiliar with Hacker News, it's a link aggregator website that users vote up stories that are interesting to the community. It is similar to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), but the community only revolves around on computer science and entrepreneurship posts.\n",
